**Motivation:** Provide an overview of the project goals and motivation.

**Related work:** Anything that inspired you, such as a paper, a web site, or something we discussed in class.

**Initial questions:** What questions are you trying to answer? How did these questions evolve over the course of the project? What new questions did you consider in the course of your analysis?

**Data:** Source, scraping method, cleaning, etc.

**Exploratory analysis:** Visualizations, summaries, and exploratory statistical analyses. Justify the steps you took, and show any major changes to your ideas.

**Additional analysis:** If you undertake formal statistical analyses, describe these in detail
Discussion: What were your findings? Are they what you expect? What insights into the data can you make?
As this will be your only chance to describe your project in detail, make sure that your report is a standalone document that fully describes your process and results. We also expect you to write high-quality code that is understandable to an outside reader. Coding collaboratively and actively reviewing code within the team will help with this!
